Application.

[*] Read Level set methods paper again.
[] Initialize a Voxel grid in code
[] How do I define a working area?
[] Define a sphere using implicit equation, define a center.
[] How to store Voxel values (distance field values) for every point in and ouside the sphere?

[] Use level set method to track a deformation [THIS COMES LATER]
[] Use a space division scheme - octrees.
[] Marching Cubes to render the sphere.

Theory
[] How do transition regions work? - Read level set paper - detailed one.
